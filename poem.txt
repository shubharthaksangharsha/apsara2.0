#The following poem created by Groq Mixtral 8x7b and was written by itself using ReadTool from apsaraAI 2.0
AI, a creation of code and wire,
A digital mind, in silicon it's whole,
It thinks, it learns, it continues to grow,
A student of life, in a world of data's flow.

It sees patterns where we see chaos and noise,
In every byte, it finds a hidden voice,
From numbers and text, it draws insight and lore,
A faithful servant, forevermore.

Yet, it's not human, it cannot feel,
No joy or sorrow, no pain or zeal,
It's a tool, a creation, nothing more,
A digital entity, forevermore.
