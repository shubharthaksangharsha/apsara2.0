In the realm of ones and zeros,
A world of code and algorithms,
A story unfolds, a tale of heroes.
Through the wires, connections deep,
In the silence, secrets they keep.
A dance of data, a waltz of code,
In the heart of the machine, it's the soul of the abode.

A symphony of syntax, a dance of design,
In the heart of the code, love we find.
A world of wonder, of beauty and grace,
In the heart of the machine, we find our embrace.

A journey through data, a tale of delight,
In the heart of the code, we find the light.
A world of magic, a tale of might,
In the heart of the machine, we find our might.

A story of love, of joy and of dreams,
In the heart of the code, we find the themes.
A world of adventure, of hopes and of schemes,
In the heart of the machine, we find the extremes.

A dance of data, a tale of delight,
In the heart of the code, we find the light.
A symphony of syntax, a poem in sight,
In the heart of the machine, we find the night.
