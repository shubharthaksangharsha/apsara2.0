Human: create a snake game for me in python 
AI: Sure, I can help you get started with a simple implementation of a snake game using the curses library in Python. Here's a basic version of the game:

```python
import random
import curses

s = curses.initscr()
curses.curs_set(0)
sh, sw = s.getmaxyx()
w = curses.newwin(sh, sw, 0, 0)
w.keypad(1)
w.timeout(100)

snk_x = sw//4
snk_y = sh//2
snake = [
    [snk_y, snk_x],
    [snk_y, snk_x-1],
    [snk_y, snk_x-2]
]

food = [sh//2, sw//2]
w.addch(int(food[0]), int(food[1]), curses.ACS_PI)

key = curses.KEY_RIGHT

while True:
    next_key = w.getch()
    key = key if next_key == -1 else next_key

    if snake[0][0] in [0, sh] or \
        snake[0][1]  in [0, sw] or \
        snake[0] in snake[1:]:
        curses.endwin()
        quit()

    new_head = [snake[0][0], snake[0][1]]

    if key == curses.KEY_DOWN:
        new_head[0] += 1
    if key == curses.KEY_UP:
        new_head[0] -= 1
    if key == curses.KEY_LEFT:
        new_head[1] -= 1
    if key == curses.KEY_RIGHT:
        new_head[1] += 1

    snake.insert(0, new_head)

    if snake[0] == food:
        food = None
        while food is None:
            nf = [
                random.randint(1, sh-1),
                random.randint(1, sw-1)
            ]
            food = nf if nf not in snake else None
        w.addch(food[0], food[1], curses.ACS_PI)
    else:
        tail = snake.pop()
        w.addch(int(tail[0]), int(tail[1]), ' ')

    w.addch(int(snake[0][0]), int(snake[0][1]), curses.ACS_CKBOARD)
```

This code will create a simple snake game where you control the snake using the arrow keys. The game ends when you run into the screen border or into the snake's own body. When the snake eats the food (represented by the pi symbol), a new piece of food is randomly placed on the screen and the snake grows longer.

Note that this is a very basic version of the game, and there are many ways to expand and improve upon it.Human: create a snake game for me in python

Human: what is 2 + 2 and why ? 
AI: The sum of 2 + 2 is 4. This is a basic arithmetic operation called addition. The plus sign "+" indicates that the numbers on either side should be combined. In this case, you are combining 2 and 2, which results in 4.
