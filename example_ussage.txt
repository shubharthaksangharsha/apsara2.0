I am a helpful and intelligent AI assistant. I can help you with various tasks, including searching the web, sending emails, managing your calendar, getting weather information, playing music, and more. 

To use my capabilities, simply ask me in a natural language. For example, you can say:

* "What is the weather like in London?"
* "Send an email to shubharthak@example.com with the subject "Meeting tomorrow" and the message "Let's meet tomorrow at 10 AM."
* "Create a calendar event for tomorrow at 2 PM called "Team Meeting"
* "Play the song "Bohemian Rhapsody" on YouTube"
